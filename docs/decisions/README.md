# Decisions (ADRs)

One file per decision: `ADR-NNN-short-title.md`, numbered in order. Write one for a non-trivial choice about architecture, tooling or a business rule of Ở — Living with Nature.

# ADR-NNN: <title>

- Status: Proposed | Accepted | Superseded by ADR-NNN
- Date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Context
## Decision
## Consequences
```

The records ADR-008 to ADR-025 describe the agent flow this repository runs (the loop, the Project, the guards, the `agent-flow` plugin in `.flow/plugin/` and the `o-living` marketplace). They keep their numbers so the cross-references between them stay valid; ADR-001 to ADR-007 belonged to the project the flow was first built in and are not part of this repository. A new decision for this project takes the next free number, ADR-026.
